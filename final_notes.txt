1. API usage
API: Application Programming Interface
-- Allows us to access outside service, so we can add features to our apps
- Weather App: Get the weather for any city
- Pizza App: Get pizza locations/menus, place orders

2. Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
We split up every component of the program into different objects. 
Describe the objects using classes, which we coded.
Menu, CreditCard, Info Page, are all different objects
Why use OOP?
-- allows us to separate different code easily, and make efficient and 
scalable designs, and describe relationships between things

3. Design Work 
Thinking about where to place each component, how to create an app that flows well 
for a good user experience.

Palindrome

oooooo

wow

"carter" is NOT a Palindrome


Given a string, how do you determine if it is a Palindrome as quickly as possible?
"bbbbbbbbbccccccccccccdddddddddasdfgiasdfgyudfgeuasdf..."
"nmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmn"

"mokom"
"abcddaiuhss"
"jiiimkiiij"


"cartercarter"



first half = left to middle
last half = right to middle


is first half = last half, flipped?

def is_palindrome(word):
    middle = len(word)/2
    left_half = word[0:middle]
    right_half = word[middle:len(word) - 1]
    right_half.reverse()
    if left_half == right_half:
        print("Palindrome")
        return True
    else 
        print("NOT a Palindrome")
        return False
